- [X] Command substitution %s:selections
- [X] Command substitution %d:cwd
- [X] Command substitution %

** Right after

- [ ] Command: pipe (think about this) (pipe selection file names/file contents)
- [ ] Allow escaping % in commands
- [ ] Rethink % substituions
- [ ] theme from config
- [ ] cd into dir symlinks
- [ ] Fix keymap evaluation? (If vd is bound, it doesnt evaluate a v binding)
- [ ] Config extend (extend = true will extend config.toml)
** Later
- [ ] cmdline tab completion
- [ ] Allow escaping % in commands
- [ ] watch for changes
- [ ] bind command: define keybindings
- [ ] some caching for file list?
- [ ] Command aliases
